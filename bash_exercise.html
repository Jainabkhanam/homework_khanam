Exercise 1:
We Use the following command to find home directory
$echo $HOME
Output:
/c/Users/auuser

To list files/folders in the home directory, we use:
$ls~
Output:
Fall23/  K/  RESUME/  Spring2024/  desktop.ini  git/

Explanation:
In Unix-based systems, the home directory is the default directory for users. 
The $HOME environment variable stores the path to the home directory. 
By using echo $HOME, we can display this path. 
The ls ~ command lists all files and folders in the home directory, allowing us to observe its contents.


Exercise 2:
$cd ~/../../..
Solution:
The command cd ~/../../.. takes up three directories from the current location.
$cd Desktop/git/files

Explanation:
The cd command is used to change directories. In this case, ~/../../.. moves up three directories from the current location. 
The tilde (~) represents the home directory, and each ../ moves up one directory level. 
By combining these, we navigate to a higher-level directory.


Exercise 3:
Solution:
We Use the man command or help command to read the manual page of ls:
$man ls (or) $help --ls
The -a flag shows all files, including hidden files.
The -l flag lists files in long format, providing detailed information.

Explanation:
The man command displays the manual page for a given command. 
By running $help --ls, we can access detailed information about the ls command, including its various options and flags. 
Understanding the -a and -l flags allows us to utilize ls more effectively for listing files.

Exercise 4:
Create a new file named myfile.txt using the touch command:
$ touch myfile.txt

Use the stat command to view information about the file:
$ stat myfile.txt
  File: myfile.txt
  Size: 27              Blocks: 1          IO Block: 65536  regular file
Device: 32ba3cf1h/851066097d    Inode: 18295873486293514  Links: 1
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)  Uid: (197609/  auuser)   Gid: (197121/ UNKNOWN)
Access: 2024-02-06 17:59:17.147107900 -0500
Modify: 2024-02-06 17:59:14.607658400 -0500
Change: 2024-02-06 17:59:14.594737500 -0500
 Birth: 2024-02-06 12:47:13.784797800 -0500

Explanation:
The touch command is used to create an empty file if it does not exist or update the last modified timestamp if it does. 
By running touch myfile.txt, we create the file myfile.txt in the current directory. 
The stat command provides detailed information about files, including access permissions, timestamps, and file size.


Exercise 5:
$ ls
Output:
myfile.txt
$ ls -l
Output:
$ ls -l
total 5
-rw-r--r-- 1 auuser 197121 1497 Feb  6 13:03 bash_exercise.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 auuser 197121   27 Feb  6 12:57 myfile.txt

Explanation:
This exercise demonstrates the difference between the basic listing provided by ls and the detailed information provided by ls -l. 
By running ls -l, we can observe additional details about the files, including their timestamps, which indicate whether the file has been recently created or updated. 
This helps us understand how to interpret the output of ls -l and identify the status of files in the directory.


Exercise6:
$ echo "This line is my first line" >> myfile.txt

$ cat myfile.txt
This line is my first line

Explanation:
In this exercise, we modify the content of myfile.txt by adding a line.
We then use the cat command to display the contents of the file. 
This demonstrates how to edit file content and verify the changes made.


Exercise 7:
$ touch myfile.txt
$ ls -l myfile.txt

Output:
total 5
-rw-r--r-- 1 auuser 197121 1497 Feb  6 13:03 bash_exercise.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 auuser 197121   27 Feb  6 17:59 myfile.txt

Explanation:
The touch command is commonly used to update the timestamps of files. 
By running touch myfile.txt, we update the timestamp of myfile.txt to the current time. 
We then use ls -l myfile.txt to view detailed information about the file, including its timestamp. 
This demonstrates how to update file timestamps and verify the changes using ls -l.
Here we can clearly see that the timestamp got updated.
